# ObstacleAssault
 A clone project of the game Fall Guys. This game was built
 using Unreal Engine 5.

## Description

The propject was only meant to be for fun and learning purposes.
The main goal of the project is to gain a better understadning of

creating member variables and functions such as UPROPERTY, 
UE_LOG(), FString, FVector, and FRotator.
